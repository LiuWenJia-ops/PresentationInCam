- Government investment

  - USA

    Investments from the US government in healthcare initiatives that will rely on AI[[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-auto4-41) include its \$1B proposed budget for the and  \$ 215M proposed investment in the [Precision Medicine Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Medicine_Initiative).[[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-45) 

  - UK

    The UK government has announced an AI investment deal worth £1 billion, in a bid to bolster the country's tech sector amid fierce competition on the global stage.

    The deal includes funding for 1,000 AI PhDs, a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, and training 8,000 specialist computer science teachers to ensure there is one in every secondary school.

    "Artificial intelligence is at the centre of our plans to make the UK the best place in the world to start and grow a digital business," Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said in a statement.

- History

  - Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system), known as [Dendral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendral).[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-7) While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for the subsequent system [MYCIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MYCIN),[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-auto2-8) considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-auto2-8)[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-9) MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-10)

  - The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time there was recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physician.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-11) Approaches involving [fuzzy set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_set) theory,[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-12) [Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network),[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-13) and [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network),[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-14)[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-15) have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare

  - 2016年2月，谷歌DeepMind公布成立DeepMind Health部门，与英国国家健康体系（NHS）合作，帮助他们辅助决策或者提高效率缩短时间。在与皇家自由医院的合作试点中，DeepMind Health开发了名为Streams的软件。这一软件用于血液测试的AKI报警平台，帮助临床医生更快地查看医疗结果。

    5月，“人工智能”首次出现在“十三五”规划草案中，5月底，发改委高技术产业司正式印发《互联网+人工智能三年行动实施方案》，明确了人工智能的总体思路、目标与主要任务。

    6月，IBM Watson联手XPRIZE设立500万美元人工智能基金项目，力促人工智能发展。

    7月，谷歌DeepMind 与 NHS（英国国家医疗服务体系）再次合作，同 Moorfields 眼科医院一起开发辨识视觉疾病的机器学习系统。通过一张眼部扫描图，该系统能够辨识出视觉疾病的早期症状，达到提前预防视觉疾病的目的。

    9月20日，IBM公司和美国麻省理工学院（MIT）宣布，将联合创建“激发大脑多媒体机器理解实验室（BM3C）”,旨在使人工智能可以像人一样看和听。

    9月28日，Facebook、Amazon、谷歌Alphabet、IBM和微软自发聚集在一起，宣布缔结新的人工智能（AI）伙伴关系，旨在进行研究和推广人工智能。

    10月21日，世界机器人大会在北京亦创国际会展中心开幕，25日圆满落幕，此次大会有几个人工智能医疗产品令人难忘，代表作是“变形金刚”胶囊，吞下后短短一分钟就在胃里完成变身，锁定病灶，拍照，回传。

  - Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have simultaneously enabled the growth healthcare-related applications of AI include: 

    - Improvements in [computing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_performance) resulting in faster data collection and data processing[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-16)
    - Increased volume and availability of health-related data from personal and healthcare-related devices[[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-17)
    - Growth of [genomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics) sequencing databases[[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-18)
    - Widespread implementation of [electronic health record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record) systems[[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-19)
    - Improvements in [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes,[[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-20)[[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-21)
    - Enhanced the precision of [robot-assisted surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-assisted_surgery) [[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare#cite_note-22)
