So hello everyone, in this part I'll summary all the previous topics and talk about something general.

In the previous topics, we explored the applications of AI in personal, institutional and nationwide scope.

In the personal scpope, AI can help us detect cancer in early stage, as well as many applications in pathology.

- Computer Vision is an important area in diagnostic applications, any important improvement will promote the development of applications in diagnostics.
- One important thing that limits the further improvements in _medical image recognition_ is data. In the history, big improvements in accuracy always result from the build of large, standardized datasets. However, many hospitals tend not to share their cases(at least in China).
- With projected rapid growth in the medical device sector, companies making efforts to bring accurate and reliable medical diagnostics based on machine and deep learning applications to market may be poised to capture a percentage of this profitable market (the huge venture investments the healthcare AI sector would seem to suggest that AI stands a chance to make a dent in the next wave of medical diagnostic tech).

In the institutional scope, we see that there are some problems in current healthcare institutions, and AI can help us with the management. Also, AI helps a lot in biomedical research. It's a perfect tool to analyse large amount of data and extract patterns behind it. That's really useful in drug discovery. Never the less, AI can be your personal health expert, working as online doctor consultations.

In the nationwide scope, ...

Thats all we've presented before, byond that, I want to talk something more general.

First is, what's the ultimate goal of us in building artificial intelligence? In my opinion, we are trying to liberate human. There are all kinds of jobs, include dangerous jobs like stunt actor, builder and soldier; include boring and error prone jobs like driver; including special jobs like prostitute. The ultimate goal of AI is to liberate human from these kinds of jobs. Of course the world is not an Utopia and most of the investigations are driven by the market, but we're kind of doing the same things.

A second quentions is, 困了先睡了。。
