So hello everyone, in this part I'll summary all the previous topics and talk about something general.

In the previous topics, we explored the applications of AI in personal, institutional and nationwide scope.

In the personal scpope, AI can help us detect cancer in early stage, as well as many applications in pathology.

- Computer Vision is an important area in diagnostic applications
- One important thing that limits the further improvements in _medical image recognition_ is the lack of data.
- medical device that provides accurate and reliable medical diagnostics is a huge profitable market.

In the institutional scope, we see that there are some problems in current healthcare institutions, and AI can help us with the management. Also, AI helps a lot in biomedical research. It's a perfect tool to analyse large amount of data and extract patterns behind it. That's really useful in drug discovery. Never the less, AI can be your personal health expert, working as online doctor consultations.

In the nationwide scope, still, AI cannot replace the human in the entire diagnostic process, but it can enable automation of trivial tasks, enabling the most urgent studies to be reviewed first and allowing specialist staff to be alerted to the more complex cases.Â It is reassuring to see commitment from Theresa May to this crucial area, that could do so much to reduce the ever growing pressure on NHS diagnostic departments.

Thats all we've presented before, beyond that, I want to talk something more general.

First is, what's the ultimate goal of us in building artificial intelligence? In my opinion, we are trying to liberate human. There are all kinds of jobs, include dangerous jobs like stunt actor, builder and soldier; include boring and error prone jobs like driver; including special jobs like prostitute. The ultimate goal of AI is to liberate human from these kinds of jobs. Of course the world is not a Utopia and most of the investigations are driven by the market, but we're kind of doing the same things.

Then, what about the development state of AI? This is a model called deep neural network, rooted in linear algebra, is has many similarities with human neural network -- each node can be regarded as a neuron and the line represents a connection. That's why we are doing the following comparisons. First, we can see that in recent years the number of connections per neuron is near to human. However, the total size of the network still have a long way to go. Currently, the largest network has roughly the same size as a bee, while they are doing fairly well on some specific tasks. Maybe if we want to achive higher intelligence, we'll need some breakthrough in computational resource.

This image indicates that, by 2015, the error rate of AI in image classification task is better that human!

For the future if AI in healthcare industry, I think that the ultimate goal is to replace doctors and nurses. Once that is true, we don't have to wait long and pay much for healthcaring. One thing we need to worry about is the accountability, which means when an AI made some mistake, who will be in charge? Maybe we need further discussion and some regulations there.

OK that's all, thanks for your listening!
